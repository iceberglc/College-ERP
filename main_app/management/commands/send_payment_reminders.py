"""
Send tuition payment reminders for unpaid invoices.

Usage:
    python manage.py send_payment_reminders
    python manage.py send_payment_reminders --due-soon-days 3 --overdue-every 3
    python manage.py send_payment_reminders --dry-run

Intended to be run daily on a cron. For each open (due/partial) invoice it
sends an in-app notification + email (+ Eskiz SMS when configured) when:
  - the due date is within --due-soon-days days (default 3), or
  - the invoice is overdue and the last reminder was sent at least
    --overdue-every days ago (default 3).

send_invoice_reminder() itself deduplicates to one reminder per invoice
per day, so re-running the command is always safe.
