"""
Null out the `image` field for DashboardStory rows whose underlying file
is missing on disk. Safe to run repeatedly; never touches stories that
have a valid file.

Why this exists:
    On ephemeral filesystems (DigitalOcean App Platform without persistent
    storage attached), any uploaded file gets wiped on redeploy. The DB
    row keeps pointing at the now-missing path, which then renders as a
    broken-image icon in the browser. This command resets those rows so
    the dashboard falls back to the emoji + colour cleanly.

    For S3-compatible backends (DigitalOcean Spaces, Amazon S3) we skip
    the check — Django can't ask `.path` of a remote file, and trusting
    the URL is the right call.

Usage:
    python manage.py cleanup_broken_stories          # write changes
    python manage.py cleanup_broken_stories --dry-run
